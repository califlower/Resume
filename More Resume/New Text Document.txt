About Me
 I'm a second year Computer Science student at Rutgers 
University with over 2.5 year of coding experience in Java . I 
have experience with mobile android development and I'm not 
afraid around new or unfamiliar hardware. As a person who 
enjoys programming, I am hoping a summer internship will 
allow me to both apply my in-classroom knowledge as well as 
learn new and useful skills in the field.
